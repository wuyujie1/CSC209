/* A line from a makefile is either a target line, an action line,
or a comment or line to ignore
     "target" line
        - Starts with a target, followed by a colon followed by a
        space-separated list of dependencies
        - A target is a word that follows the Rule of valid file names
        (assume that only valid file names are used in testing)
        - The colon has a space on either side of it
        - assume the line will not exceed MAXLINE
        - The list of dependencies follow the same Rule as the target

     "action" line
        - Begins with a tab
        - Contains a line that can be executed. First word is the relative path
        to the executable, remaining tokens are argument to the executable.
        - relative path means that if the executable is in the current working
        directory, the path begins with "./" (Do not assume "." is in the path)

     Comment or empty line
        - contains only spaces and/or tabs
        - contains 0 or more spaces or tabs followed by a '#'.  Any other
          characters after the '#' are ignored.
